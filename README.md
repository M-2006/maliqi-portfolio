# 💼 Maliqi Portfolio – Personal Developer Website

Welcome to my personal developer portfolio project! This website is built to showcase my journey, skills, and the various projects I’ve worked on. It reflects my growth as a developer and is continuously updated as I build more real-world applications.

## 📌 About the Project

This portfolio is a fully responsive, frontend-only web application built with **React.js**. It serves as a professional space where visitors can:

- Explore who I am and what I do
- Browse my featured projects and repositories
- Connect with me via social platforms
- Learn about my experience and skills

The application also fetches a list of my public GitHub repositories using a **custom API endpoint** that I created to streamline and format the data.
